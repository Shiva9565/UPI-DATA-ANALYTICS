# Transaction Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing transaction data using Python, SQL, and Tableau. It provides insights into transaction trends across major Indian cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore) through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Features
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:** Visualizes key transaction metrics with dynamic filtering options.
- **Filters for Customization:** Users can filter by currency type, bank names, device types, and payment modes.
- **Merchant Categorization:** Transactions are analyzed to categorize merchants based on volume.
- **Trend Analysis:** Insights into transaction trends and payment method distributions.
- **Demographic Insights:** Examines age-group-specific transaction behaviors to support marketing strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data preprocessing and analysis.
- **SQL** for querying and managing transaction data.
- **Tableau** for data visualization and dashboard development.
